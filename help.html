<h2>Information</h2>

	Information for people who don't use Star Products
Star Platforms, Inc. ("Star", "we", "our" or "us") processes your name, mobile phone number and/or your email address if we receive it from our users through the contact uploading or contact syncing feature available on StarBook, StarChat or Stargram ("contact uploading"). We process this information even if you are not a user of StarBook, StarChat or Stargram and/or don't have an account with us (a "non-user").
About contact uploading and how it works
When a user uses contact uploading and grants us access to their device's address book. We will access and upload the names, phone numbers and email addresses in their address book on a daily basis to our servers, including those of both users of StarBook, StarChat and/or Stargram and other contacts who are not users or don't have an account (i.e. non-users).
What information is collected about non-users?
We collect the name, mobile phone number and/or email address of a user's contacts.
How do we use a non-user's information?
Contact uploading is an optional feature where users can choose to upload their device's address book to StarBook, StarChat and/or Stargram. We process the names, phone numbers and/or email addresses in the address book to see if any of the numbers or email addresses belong to users. If a user's contact is also on StarBook, StarChat and/or Stargram, we can suggest this contact on StarBook as someone to send a friend request to in the StarBook user's People you may know or as a suggested account to follow on Stargram. Users can also invite non-users to join StarBook, StarChat and/or Stargram via text or email.
Contact uploading also allows us to suggest a non-user who joins as a user of StarBook as a friend to add for the user through People you may know or as a suggested account to follow on Stargram.
Finally, we will also use the address books uploaded to investigate suspicious activity on the Star Products and keep our platform safe and secure. We also conduct business intelligence and analytics using the address books uploaded to accurately count people and users of the Star Company Products.
Star shares information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Star Companies. We share non-users' data with other Star Companies to be able to provide the contact import feature and for the purposes set out above.
We retain non-users' personal information for as long as needed to provide the contact importer feature to users and for the purposes described above. In certain cases, we need to keep your contact information for longer, including after you ask us to erase it. This includes for legal reasons such as to respond to a legal request or comply with applicable law, for regulatory or litigation matters, to prevent harm or for safety, security and integrity purposes. The length of time we need to keep it will depend on the specific reason.
How non-users can exercise their rights
We provide non-users with the ability to exercise their rights under applicable laws. To exercise your rights, contact us using the contact information below.
You can learn more about how privacy works on StarBook and on Stargram, and in the StarBook Help Centre.
We hope that we can satisfy any queries that a non-user may have about the way in which we process their personal information. In some countries you may also be able to contact the data protection officer for Star Platforms, Inc., and depending on your jurisdiction, you may also contact your local Data Protection Authority ("DPA") directly.

How we transfer information
We share the information that we collect globally, both internally across our offices and data centres, and externally with our partners, service providers and vendors. As Star is global, with users, partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including to enable us to operate and provide the services described in this Data Notice.
Non-user information will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:
Places where we have infrastructure or data centres, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, amongst others
Countries where Star Products are available
Other countries where our partners, service providers and vendors are located outside the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Data Notice.
We rely on appropriate mechanisms for international data transfers. For example, for information we collect:
We utilise standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and by other relevant authorities.
We rely on determinations from the European Commission, and from other relevant authorities, about whether other countries have adequate levels of data protection.
We use equivalent mechanisms under applicable laws that apply to data transfers to the United States and other relevant countries.
